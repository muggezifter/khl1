This is the very first version of KHL. I wrote it on a Commodore 64 running [Simons' Basic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simons'_BASIC), probably in 1996. It was the first program I ever wrote, and I guess it shows... I have copied in manually from the screen of my monitor, so I can not guarantee there are no typo's.
